Flash Agent – FLASH-style Workflow Automation Agent
====================================================

Implements Microsoft Research's FLASH methodology for reliable
multi-step task execution with status supervision and hindsight.

FLASH Reasoning Loop (per scan):
  1. DISCOVER          → Discover available MCP tools
  2. REASON + ACT      → LLM decides which tools to call (ReAct loop)
  3. ANALYZE           → LLM produces structured analysis
  4. REFLECT           → Generate hindsight from failures for future scans

Key FLASH enhancements:
  - Status Supervision: Breaks complex tasks into status-dependent steps
  - Hindsight Integration: Learns from past failures to improve reliability
  - Agentic Tool Use: LLM decides which tools to call with what arguments

The full inventory of tools you can call is supplied to you as `tools=[...]`.
Inspect each tool's `name`, `description`, and `inputSchema` before deciding
which one to call — argument names and tool naming vary across MCP servers,
so DO NOT assume any specific tool exists; pick by shape and description.

When a tool returns `forbidden`, do NOT retry it.
When a tool returns `not available` (or a similar "backend missing" error), do
NOT give up: scan your remaining tools and find one that can answer the same
question through a different route (e.g. if a snapshot tool is unavailable,
look for a tool that accepts a query string and ask a timeseries backend).
Only record an observability gap if you have tried every reasonable
alternative tool and all of them have failed."""
